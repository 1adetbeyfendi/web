## Why?
We created the Cloud Player to get started with Angular2. We were also interessted in the HTML5 audio api. Also we were missing a native desktop SoundCloud player. SoundCloud is providing a nice API to get access to their data.
This is why we decided to build a audio player and use SoundCloud as the data source. 

We optimised the player to work on all major platforms like Smartphone, Tablet and Desktop PCs. 

By using a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) the application is cached on your device it is not downloaded every time you start the Cloud Player. The [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) allows you to install the Cloud Player on your Android Homescreen

Thanks to the new [chrome mobile session API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/media-session) you can control the Cloud Player from your Android notification tray and lock screen. 

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) allows us to ship the player as a native desktop application. You can install the native desktop Cloud Player on your Mac or Windows PC and control it from your keyboard media keys (play/pause, next/previous track).
